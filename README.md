# COMP 582 Test Harness

This repository contains unit tests and supporting artifacts for the
Automatic Quiz Generation project. Each team member chose a user story
from the main project and contributed 4–5 unit tests related to that
user story. Files are named and commented with contributor names to
make individual contributions clear.

## How to Run Tests (Optional)

These tests are written using Python and pytest for demonstration purposes.

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest

### Step 6 – Stage files with Git

Check what you’ve got:

```bash
ls
# You should see: README.md  user-stories/  tests/


quit
