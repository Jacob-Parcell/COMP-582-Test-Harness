# User Story – Shyam Thummar 

As a quiz author, I want to upload a classroom material file (PDF, DOCX,
or TXT) and choose quiz difficulty and length so that I can automatically
generate a quiz and answer key from my existing content.

Acceptance criteria:
- The system accepts a valid file and does not crash.
- The user can choose difficulty (easy, medium, advanced).
- The user can choose length (5, 10, 15, or 20 questions).
- The system returns quiz data aligned with the chosen parameters.
